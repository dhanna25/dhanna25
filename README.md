## About Me
I am a student at the University of Notre Dame, studying Psychology and Arabic with a minor in Data Science. My academic journey includes studying abroad in Sydney, Australia, and completing an Arabic immersion program in Amman, Jordan. Professionally, I’ve interned at Morgan Stanley in Wealth Management and worked as a research assistant, using my Arabic skills to support interventions for Palestinian families. I’ve mentored children with disabilities at Shake-A-Leg Miami, tutored students in Math and Science, and served as a coxswain for Notre Dame Men’s Rowing, leading my team to competitive success. I’m also a classically trained violinist and am passionate about traveling, running, rowing, and reading.
